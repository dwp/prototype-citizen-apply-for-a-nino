    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should only apply online if you need a National Insurance number to
      work in the UK.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Find your identity documents</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have the following documents, get them ready before you start:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a passport from any country</li>
      <li>a biometric residence permit (BRP)</li>
      <li>
        a national identity card from an EU country or from Norway,
        Liechtenstein or Switzerland
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may need to enter information from one or more of these documents –
      for example, your passport number and your BRP number, if you have these.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you do not have any of these identity documents, you can still apply
      online. At the end of your application, you will need to make an
      appointment with us to prove your identity.
    </p>

    <br /><br />

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prepare to take digital photos</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may need to take and upload photos of your identity documents and of
      yourself holding your passport. Do not take these photos yet: we will
      explain what you need to do.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have a smartphone, tablet or a digital camera, make sure these are
      charged and working before you start.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you cannot upload photos, you can still apply online. At the end of
      your application, you will need to make an appointment with us to prove
      your identity.
    </p>
